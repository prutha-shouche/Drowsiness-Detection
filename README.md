# Drowsiness-Detection

## Description:

Driver fatigue is a significant factor in a large number of road accidents that mainly happen due to human error. The development of technologies for detecting or preventing drowsiness of the drivers at the earliest stage itself is a major challenge in the field of accident avoidance systems. This is a project based on the implementation of Artificial Intelligence and OpenCV concepts to detect drowsiness of a person and sound an alarm once detected.

In the proposed algorithm, first, video data is collected and analyzed using a new approach. In this approach, the image frames taken are enhanced with a sharpening module. Second, a new interpretation of these frames and a combination of the results of the facial key features will be presented for every extracted bounding box. The new interpretation will lead to a clearer and better distinction of the states of features. Finally, we will present a new decision-making algorithm which will result in a more robust drowsiness detection and less false alarms. The rest of the section describes the implementation, flow and working for the system.
